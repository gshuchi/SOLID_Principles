# Liskov Substitution Principle

It States that -

``Objects of a SuperClass must be replacable or interchangable with objects of its SubClasses without breaking the code.``

## Note-

- It basically works on OOP's `Inheritance`  Concept.
- We can't have different return type for Overridden methods in Super & Sub Classes.
- Method's Signature should be same across all the overridden methods.
