# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

SRP states that a class should have single responsibility for its functionality.

This does not means that we should have 100s of classes based on functionalities of the framework.

Having too many classes is not going to slow down framework's performance in any way.

We need to keep in mind two things while creating classes:- 

### - Does this class has two or more responsibilities?
### - Do I have to update this class in future?

If the answer to the above questions is - `YES!` 

Then we should apply `SRP Principle` in the designing the framework.
This will help in increasing - 
### - Readability 
### - Maintainability
